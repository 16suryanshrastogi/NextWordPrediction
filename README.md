# NextWordPrediction
Next word prediction is a language modelling task in Machine Learning that aims to predict the most probable word or sequence of words that follows a given input context. This task utilizes statistical patterns and linguistic structures to generate accurate predictions based on the context provided
To build a Next Word Prediction model:
start by collecting a diverse dataset of text documents, 
preprocess the data by cleaning and tokenizing it, 
prepare the data by creating input-output pairs, 
engineer features such as word embeddings, 
select an appropriate model like an LSTM or GPT, 
train the model on the dataset while adjusting hyperparameters,
improve the model by experimenting with different techniques and architectures.
